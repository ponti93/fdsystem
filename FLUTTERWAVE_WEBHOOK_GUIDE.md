# 🔗 Flutterwave Webhook Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Do We Need Webhooks?**

### **For Real Production: YES!**
### **For Testing: We have 2 options!**

---

## 🔄 **Current Setup (Option 1: Simulation)**

### **What We Have Now:**
✅ **Webhook simulation** - Perfect for testing fraud detection  
✅ **Real payment links** - Actual Flutterwave payment pages  
✅ **Live fraud analysis** - Your RNN model processes everything  
✅ **Database storage** - All data is real and persistent  

### **How It Works:**
1. **Create Payment Link** → Real Flutterwave payment page
2. **Simulate Webhook** → Triggers your fraud detection
3. **Real Analysis** → RNN + Rules + Velocity analysis
4. **Live Results** → Stored in PostgreSQL database

### **Test Now:**
- Go to http://localhost:3000/payment-test
- Enter payment details
- See real fraud detection results!

## 🌐 **Real Webhooks Setup (Option 2: Production-like)**

### **Why Real Webhooks?**
- **Actual payment flow** from Flutterwave
- **Real webhook delivery** to your system
- **Production-identical testing**
- **Complete end-to-end validation**

### **Setup Steps:**

#### **1. Install Ngrok (Tunnel Tool):**
```bash
# Download from: https://ngrok.com/download
# Extract and add to PATH
ngrok --version
```

#### **2. Run Our Webhook Setup:**
```bash
python setup_webhooks.py
```

#### **3. Configure Flutterwave Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/settings/webhooks
- Set Webhook URL: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/flutterwave`
- Set Secret Hash: `flutterwave_webhook_secret_123`
- Enable events: `charge.completed`, `charge.failed`

#### **4. Test Real Payments:**
- Use the payment interface
- Make real test payments
- Flutterwave sends webhooks to your system
- Watch real-time fraud detection!

## 🔍 **Current vs Real Webhook Flow:**

### **Current Flow (Simulation):**
```
Customer → Payment Form → Flutterwave Payment Link
                       ↓
Your System ← Simulated Webhook ← [Manual Trigger]
     ↓
Fraud Detection → Database → Dashboard
```

### **Real Webhook Flow:**
```
Customer → Payment Form → Flutterwave Payment Link → Flutterwave Servers
                                                           ↓
Your System ← Real Webhook ← Flutterwave (automatic)
     ↓
Fraud Detection → Database → Dashboard
```

## 🧪 **Testing Options:**

### **Option A: Quick Testing (Current)**
✅ **Ready now** - No setup required  
✅ **Perfect for fraud detection testing**  
✅ **Real RNN model analysis**  
✅ **Live database storage**  

**Use when:** Testing fraud algorithms, model performance, dashboard features

### **Option B: Real Webhook Testing**
🔧 **Requires ngrok setup**  
✅ **Production-identical flow**  
✅ **Real Flutterwave integration**  
✅ **Complete end-to-end testing**  

**Use when:** Testing production deployment, webhook reliability, complete payment flow

---

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**

### **Start with Option A (Current Setup):**
1. **Test your fraud detection** with the payment interface
2. **Verify RNN model accuracy** 
3. **Check dashboard analytics**
4. **Validate Flutterwave integration**

### **Then Upgrade to Option B:**
1. **Run webhook setup script**
2. **Configure Flutterwave dashboard**
3. **Test real webhook delivery**
4. **Validate production readiness**

## 💳 **Your Flutterwave Test Cards:**

### **Successful Payments:**
- **Card**: `5399834000000002`
- **CVV**: `123`
- **Expiry**: `12/26`

### **Failed Payments:**
- **Card**: `5399834000000010`
- **CVV**: `123`
- **Expiry**: `12/26`

---

## 🚀 **Ready to Test?**

### **Current Setup (Immediate):**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/payment-test
2. Enter card details
3. Process payment
4. See fraud analysis results!

### **Real Webhooks (Advanced):**
1. Run: `python setup_webhooks.py`
2. Configure Flutterwave dashboard
3. Test with real webhook delivery!

**Both options give you real fraud detection with your trained RNN model!** 🛡️
